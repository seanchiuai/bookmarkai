# Design Stealer

Copies an existing landing page (from URL or image) into a specified page in the codebase using Playwright MCP. Iteratively refines the implementation until it matches the reference design and interactions as closely as possible. Use when the user wants to copy/reference/steal an existing landing page/url to replicate in their app
